#our-story

Crowdsourced book-writing app using MEAN stack + Sails.js. Users submit and vote on the next word in an ongoing story written by the human race. Every hour on the hour, the highest voted word is written into the book permanently.

* PostgreSQL
* Sails/Express/Node
* Angular
* Bootstrap

#TODO

* Client-side and server-side validation for word creation (no duplicates, single word strings)
* Session cookies (only one vote per word per visitor)
* UI/UX Design and implementation
* Tiebreaking for handling equal score counts
* Sockets.io integration for live updating story
* Pagination via Angular
